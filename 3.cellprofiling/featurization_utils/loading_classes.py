class ImageSetLoader:
    """
    A class to load an image set consisting of raw z stack images from multiple spectral
    channels and segmentation masks.
    The images are loaded into a dictionary, and various attributes and compartments
    are extracted from the images. The class also provides methods to retrieve images
    and their attributes.
    Parameters
    ----------
    image_set_path : pathlib.Path
        Path to the image set directory.
    anisotropy_spacing : tuple
        The anisotropy spacing of the images. In the format (z_spacing, y_spacing, x_spacing).
    channel_mapping : dict
        A dictionary mapping channel names to their corresponding image file names.
        Example: {'nuclei': 'nuclei_', 'cell': 'cell_', 'cytoplasm': 'cytoplasm_'}
    Attributes
    ----------
    image_set_name : str
        The name of the image set.
    anisotropy_spacing : tuple
        The anisotropy spacing of the images.
    anisotropy_factor : float
        The anisotropy factor calculated from the spacing.
    image_set_dict : dict
        A dictionary containing the loaded images, with keys as channel names.
    unique_mask_objects : dict
        A dictionary containing unique object IDs for each mask in the image set.
    unique_compartment_objects : dict
        A dictionary containing unique object IDs for each compartment in the image set.
        Where a compartment is defined as a segmented region in the image.
        For example typically the Cell, Cytoplasm, Nuclei, and in this case also Organoid.
        The compartments are bounds for measurements.
    image_names : list
        A list of image names in the image set.
    compartments : list
        A list of compartment names in the image set.
    Methods
    -------
    retrieve_image_attributes()
        Retrieves unique object IDs for each mask in the image set.
    get_unique_objects_in_compartments()
        Retrieves unique object IDs for each compartment in the image set.
    get_image(key)
        Retrieves the image corresponding to the specified key from the image set dictionary.
    get_image_names()
        Retrieves the names of images in the image set.
