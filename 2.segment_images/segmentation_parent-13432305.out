sbatch: Note: Users are limited to using a maximum of 16, 15, and 6 total GPUs on the "aa100", "ami100", and "al40" partitions, respectively, across all of their running jobs. A maximum of 22 total GPUs per user is allowed simultaneously across all types of GPUs. Additional jobs will remain queued. The GPUs are heavily used and it is not uncommon for wait times to exceed 24 hours during peak periods. Please be aware that "squeue" shows the temporal order that jobs were scheduled, and is not an accurate indicator of the position of your job(s) in the queue. The wait time for any job is a function of the recent usage by the user and their institution, the specified size and duration of the job, the qos, and the age of the job.
